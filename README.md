# React & Redux - Catalogue of Statistics

In this project, I'm using 2 different APIs to retrieve data about music artists and their most famous albums.
You only type the artist's name and you get back their short bio, an artist's image, their most famous albums along with individual album's information which pop up in the form of a modal, covering the whole browser. At the right side of the album's section you can find 10 similar artists, based on the artist's genre. You can click at any of these links and you will see its details in the same page. Lastly, just below the artist's image you can find some extra details taken from its profile at Last.fm, a website I used to retrieve the data from.
Feel free to check the live version of my application by click the Live Demo Link.
